<h3 class="htory">History of Thinadhoo</h3>
<p class="storys"><strong>Thinadhoo is known to have a rich history.</strong> </p>
<hr class="hstrypage"/>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p class="story"> Thinadhoo reverted from Islam shortly after conversion. This is likely to be a political move in order to establish a military occupation as there is no evidence of practice of Buddhism after the conversion. The first to convert were from Suvadive.</p>

    </li>
    <li><p class="story">Suvadive was already a flourishing fishing industry with its own sustained economy when the Havaru was established.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="story"> Bodu Thakurufaanu using the backstory of reversion from Islam sent his Generals, dubbed 'Havaru', who were based in Malé. They were organized as two ranks of three divisions each: the Is Thinvaru (the lead three powers) - Dhoshimeynaa Varu, Velaanaa Varu and Hakuraa Varu; and the Fas Thinvaru (the rear three powers) - Maafaiy Varu, Dhaharaa Varu and Faamuladheyri Varu.</p>
   
    </li>
    <li> <p class="story">These 'Havaru' went to Thinadhoo and recaptured the island after much bloodshed. The generals then returned to Malé and for their victory Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam offered them the island of Thinadhoo, He ordered that the 'dhandu kolhu', 'medhu ruganddu' and 'Baraaseel' to be given to Havaru along with the islands of Thinadhoo Maahuttaa, Kaadedhdhoo and Kuddu. The island itself was renamed Havaru Thinadhoo signifying the occupation.</p> 
    </li>
    <li><p class="story"> When 'havaru' were given these six regions they leased them to the people of Thinadhoo under the Vaaru system. Each year Thinadhoo people were to send the annual Varuvaa to the 'Havaru' based in Male'. This practice lasted till the sultanate of Muhammad Mueenuddeen I who was the sultan of the Maldives from 1798 to 1835.</p>
    </li>
    <li> <p class="story"> This practice was abolished by the orders of Prime Minister Ibrahim Nasir.</p>

  <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="istory">The Maldive boat Enamaa was carrying far more than its capacity of up to 126 when a wave overturned it. Twenty one people died with two missing when Enamaa capsized into the sea of Gaafu Dhaalu atoll on 17 March 2004.
